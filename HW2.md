[x] I solemly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part
of this assignment (except that auto-generated by Django).

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was definitely flex box.I had a little
experience with HTML before this class but not with CSS. CSS is way more powerful than the basic
styling with just HTML, ESPECIALLY flex box, considering you kinda have to use tables to mimic the
formatting that flex box offers.

The hardest thing in this assignment was getting all the changes made to work together. Sometimes
padding from one thing messes with padding in another thing, and so on. I also found it kinda hard to
work with flex box INSIDE a table, that was a bit touchy to get right.
