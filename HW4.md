The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was following these step by step instructions, it wasn't really all that hard to get a website running on the internet.
It was actually really cool to see the process behind renting a computer and getting it setup through AWS (even if I didn't fully understand all of it).

The hardest thing in this assignment was not much really, I went through with no issues and felt the instructions were pretty good at guiding me through.
