The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was certain rules and formatting of HTML that need
to be considered. There are lots of directions to take it and deciding between which ones make the most sense
was sometimes a little difficult.

The hardest thing in this assignment was learning how all the HTML tags work with each other. Some techniques and
combinations of tags either don't work as you expect, are outdated, or don't work at all.
